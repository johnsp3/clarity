# Timestamp Preservation Fix Summary

## Problem
Notes were showing "Just now" for all timestamps, even for notes created 15-20 minutes ago or longer. This was happening because:
1. Timestamps were being updated every time ANY change was made to a note
2. Firebase timestamps weren't being converted properly when loaded from the database

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Firebase Save Function**
- **Location**: `src/services/firebaseNotes.ts` (line 44)
- **Issue**: The `saveNote` function was always using `serverTimestamp()` for `updatedAt`, overwriting the existing timestamp
- **Fix**: Changed to `updatedAt: note.updatedAt || serverTimestamp()` to preserve existing timestamps

### 2. **Firebase Timestamp Conversion**
- **Location**: `src/services/firebaseNotes.ts` (line 18)
- **Issue**: The `timestampToDate` helper wasn't properly handling Firebase timestamp objects (with `seconds` and `nanoseconds` properties)
- **Fix**: Added proper conversion logic to handle Firebase timestamp objects:
  ```typescript
  if (timestamp && typeof timestamp === 'object' && 'seconds' in timestamp && 'nanoseconds' in timestamp) {
    const date = new Date(timestamp.seconds * 1000 + timestamp.nanoseconds / 1000000);
    return date;
  }
  ```

### 3. **Update Note Logic**
- **Location**: `src/store/useStore.ts` (line 260)
- **Issue**: The `updateNote` function only updated timestamps when content changed, but the Firebase save was still overwriting them
- **Fix**: Already correctly implemented - only updates timestamp when `updates.content !== undefined`

### 4. **Migration Function**
- **Location**: `src/App.tsx` (line 69)
- **Issue**: The migration was running on every app load, updating all notes
- **Fix**: Added localStorage check to only run migration once per browser

## How It Works Now

1. **Content Updates**: When note content is changed, the timestamp is updated to the current time
2. **Non-Content Updates**: When only metadata is changed (tags, title, favorites, etc.), the timestamp is preserved
3. **Firebase Sync**: The Firebase save function now respects the timestamp from the note object instead of always using server time
4. **Firebase Loading**: When notes are loaded from Firebase, timestamps are properly converted from Firebase format to JavaScript Date objects
5. **Migration**: Only runs once per browser to avoid unnecessary timestamp updates

## Testing
You can verify the fix by:
1. Creating a new note
2. Waiting a few minutes
3. Adding/removing tags - the timestamp should remain unchanged
4. Editing the content - the timestamp should update to "Just now"
5. Refreshing the page - timestamps should be preserved and show correct relative times

## Files Modified
- `src/services/firebaseNotes.ts` - Fixed timestamp preservation in Firebase save and proper conversion when loading
- `src/store/useStore.ts` - Already had correct logic for content-only timestamp updates
- `src/App.tsx` - Added one-time migration check
