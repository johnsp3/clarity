Subject: Following up on my visit - John Chezik

Hi Dr. Burt,

I hope you're doing well! I'm John Chezik - I came in about 10 days ago regarding my upper left back tooth.

You mentioned you'd check with the root specialist about possible treatment options for my case. I know you're busy (and it's vacation season!), but I wanted to touch base and see if you've had a chance to discuss it with them.

As we talked about, my diabetes makes implants tricky right now. The good news is I'm making real progress with my blood sugar management. If there's any alternative that could buy me some time before needing an implant, I'd love to hear about it.

Whenever you have a moment, feel free to email or WhatsApp me with any updates. And if you think another look would help, I'm happy to come back in.

Thanks so much for your help with this!

Best,
John Chezik
